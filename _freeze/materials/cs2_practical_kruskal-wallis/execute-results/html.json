In this way it is an extension of the Mann-Whitney test for two groups.\n\n## Libraries and functions\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Click to expand\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n### Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# A collection of R packages designed for data science\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Converts stats functions to a tidyverse-friendly format\nlibrary(rstatix)\n\n# Creates diagnostic plots using ggplot2\nlibrary(ggResidpanel)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Functions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Performs a Kruskal-Wallis test\nstats::kruskal.test()\n\n# Performs Dunn's test for pairwise multiple comparisons of the ranked data\nrstatix::dunn_test()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n### Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# A Python data analysis and manipulation tool\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Simple yet exhaustive stats functions.\nimport pingouin as pg\n\n# Python equivalent of `ggplot2`\nfrom plotnine import *\n\n# Post-hoc tests\nimport scikit_posthocs as sp\n\n# Statistical models, conducting tests and statistical data exploration\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Convenience interface for specifying models using formula strings and DataFrames\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Functions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Summary statistics\npandas.DataFrame.describe()\n\n# Plots the first few rows of a DataFrame\npandas.DataFrame.head()\n\n# Query the columns of a DataFrame with a boolean expression\n#pandas.DataFrame.query()\n\n# Reads in a .csv file\npandas.read_csv\n\n# Performs an analysis of variance\n#pingouin.anova()\n\n# Tests for equality of variance\npingouin.homoscedasticity()\n\n# Performs the Kruskal-Wallis test\npingouin.kruskal\n\n# Performs the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality\npingouin.normality()\n\n# Creates a model from a formula and data frame\nstatsmodels.formula.api.ols\n\n# Creates an ANOVA table for one or more fitted linear models\nstatsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Data and hypotheses\n\nFor example, suppose a behavioural ecologist records the rate at which [spider monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_monkey) behaved aggressively towards one another, as a function of how closely related the monkeys are. The familiarity of the two monkeys involved in each interaction is classified as `high`, `low` or `none.` We want to test if the data support the hypothesis that aggression rates differ according to strength of relatedness. We form the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\n-   $H_0$: The median aggression rates for all types of familiarity are the same\n-   $H_1$: The median aggression rates are not all equal\n\nWe will use a Kruskal-Wallis test to check this.\n\nThe data are stored in the file `data/CS2-spidermonkey.csv`.\n\n## Summarise and visualise\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nFirst we read the data in:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspidermonkey <- read_csv(\"data/CS2-spidermonkey.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# look at the data\nspidermonkey\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 21 × 3\n      id aggression familiarity\n   <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>      \n 1     1        0.2 high       \n 2     2        0.1 high       \n 3     3        0.4 high       \n 4     4        0.8 high       \n 5     5        0.3 high       \n 6     6        0.5 high       \n 7     7        0.2 high       \n 8     8        0.5 low        \n 9     9        0.4 low        \n10    10        0.3 low        \n# ℹ 11 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# summarise the data\nspidermonkey %>% \n  select(-id) %>% \n  group_by(familiarity) %>% \n  get_summary_stats(type = \"common\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 11\n  familiarity variable       n   min   max median   iqr  mean    sd    se    ci\n  <chr>       <fct>      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 high        aggression     7   0.1   0.8    0.3  0.25 0.357 0.237 0.09  0.219\n2 low         aggression     7   0.3   1.2    0.5  0.3  0.629 0.315 0.119 0.291\n3 none        aggression     7   0.9   1.6    1.2  0.25 1.26  0.23  0.087 0.213\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create boxplot\nggplot(spidermonkey,\n       aes(x = familiarity, y = aggression)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs2_practical_kruskal-wallis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Python\nFirst we read the data in:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nspidermonkey_py = pd.read_csv(\"data/CS2-spidermonkey.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# look at the data\nspidermonkey_py.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   id  aggression familiarity\n0   1         0.2        high\n1   2         0.1        high\n2   3         0.4        high\n3   4         0.8        high\n4   5         0.3        high\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# summarise the data\nspidermonkey_py.describe()[\"aggression\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ncount    21.000000\nmean      0.747619\nstd       0.460021\nmin       0.100000\n25%       0.400000\n50%       0.600000\n75%       1.200000\nmax       1.600000\nName: aggression, dtype: float64\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# create boxplot\n(ggplot(spidermonkey_py,\n        aes(x = \"familiarity\",\n            y = \"aggression\")) +\n     geom_boxplot())\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\nThe data appear to show a very significant difference in aggression rates between the three types of familiarity. We would probably expect a reasonably significant result here.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nTo use the Kruskal-Wallis test we have to make three assumptions:\n\n1.  The parent distributions from which the samples are drawn have the same shape (if they're normal then we should use a one-way ANOVA)\n2.  Each data point in the samples is independent of the others\n3.  The parent distributions should have the same variance\n\nIndependence we'll ignore as usual. Similar shape is best assessed from the earlier visualisation of the data. That means that we only need to check equality of variance.\n\n### Equality of variance\n\nWe test for equality of variance using Levene's test (since we can't assume normal parent distributions which rules out Bartlett's test).\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# perform Levene's test\nlevene_test(aggression ~ familiarity,\n            data = spidermonkey)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in leveneTest.default(y = y, group = group, ...): group coerced to\nfactor.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n    df1   df2 statistic     p\n  <int> <int>     <dbl> <dbl>\n1     2    18     0.114 0.893\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe relevant p-value is given in the `p` column (0.893). As it is quite large we see that each group do appear to have the same variance.\n\nThere is also a warning about `group coerced to factor`. There is no need to worry about this - Levene's test needs to compare different groups and because `familiarity` is encoded as a character value, it converts it to a categorical one before running the test.\n\n## Python\nWe can run Levene's test with the `pg.homoscedasticity()` function. We previously used this for Bartlett's test, but it allows us to define Levene's instead.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npg.homoscedasticity(dv = \"aggression\",\n                    group = \"familiarity\",\n                    method = \"levene\",\n                    data = spidermonkey_py)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n               W      pval  equal_var\nlevene  0.113924  0.892964       True\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Implement and interpret the test\n\nPerform a Kruskal-Wallis test on the data:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# implement Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(aggression ~ familiarity,\n             data = spidermonkey)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tKruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  aggression by familiarity\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.597, df = 2, p-value = 0.001115\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The first argument must be in the formula format: `variable ~ category`\n-   The second argument must be the name of the data frame\n\nThe p-value is given in the 3rd line. This shows us the probability of getting samples such as ours if the null hypothesis were actually true.\n\n## Python\nWe can use the `kruskal()` function from `pingouin` to perform the Kruskal-Wallis test:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npg.kruskal(dv = \"aggression\",\n           between = \"familiarity\",\n           data = spidermonkey_py)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n              Source  ddof1          H     p-unc\nKruskal  familiarity      2  13.597156  0.001115\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nSince the p-value is very small (much smaller than the standard significance level of 0.05) we can say \"that it is very unlikely that these three samples came from the same parent distribution and as such we can reject our null hypothesis\" and state that:\n\n> A Kruskal-Wallis test showed that aggression rates between spidermonkeys depends upon the degree of familiarity between them (p = 0.0011).\n\n## Post-hoc testing (Dunn's test)\n\nThe equivalent of Tukey's range test for non-normal data is **Dunn's test**.\n\nDunn's test is used to check for significant differences in group medians:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nThe `dunn_test()` function comes from the `rstatix` package, so make sure you have that loaded.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# perform Dunn's test\ndunn_test(aggression ~ familiarity,\n          data = spidermonkey)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 9\n  .y.        group1 group2    n1    n2 statistic        p    p.adj p.adj.signif\n* <chr>      <chr>  <chr>  <int> <int>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>       \n1 aggression high   low        7     7      1.41 0.160    0.160    ns          \n2 aggression high   none       7     7      3.66 0.000257 0.000771 ***         \n3 aggression low    none       7     7      2.25 0.0245   0.0490   *           \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `dunn_test()` function performs a Kruskal-Wallis test on the data, followed by a post-hoc pairwise multiple comparison.\n\nThe comparison between the pairs of groups is reported in the table at the bottom. Each row contains a single comparison. We are interested in the `p` and `p.adj` columns, which contain the the p-values that we want. This table shows that there isn't a significant difference between the high and low groups, as the p-value (0.1598) is too high. The other two comparisons between the high familiarity and no familiarity groups and between the low and no groups are significant though.\n\nThe `dunn_test()` function has several arguments, of which the `p.adjust.method` is likely to be of interest. Here you can define which method needs to be used to account for multiple comparisons. The default is `\"none\"`. We'll cover more about this in the chapter on [Power analysis](#cs6-intro).\n\n## Python\nUnfortunately `pingouin` does not seem to have function that can perform Dunn's test, so we need to import this from elsewhere.\n\nThere is a series of post-hocs tests available via `scikit_posthocs`. You'll need to install this by running:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npip install scikit-posthocs\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter installation, load it with:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport scikit_posthocs as sp\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we can perform Dunn's test as follows:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nsp.posthoc_dunn(spidermonkey_py,\n                val_col = \"aggression\",\n                group_col = \"familiarity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          high       low      none\nhigh  1.000000  0.159777  0.000257\nlow   0.159777  1.000000  0.024493\nnone  0.000257  0.024493  1.000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe p-values of the pairwise comparisons are reported in the table. This table shows that there isn't a significant difference between the high and low groups, as the p-value (0.1598) is too high. The other two comparisons between the high familiarity and no familiarity groups and between the low and no groups are significant though.\n\nThe `sp.posthoc_dunn()` function has several arguments, of which the `p_adjust` is likely to be of interest. Here you can define which method needs to be used to account for multiple comparisons.
