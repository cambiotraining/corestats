It contains data on air pollution levels measured in London, in 2019. It also contains several meteorological measurements. Each variable was recorded on a daily basis.\n\nNote: some of the variables are based on simulations.\n\nIt contains the following variables:\n\n| variable | explanation |\n|:--|:--|\n| `avg_temp`| average daily temperature ($^\\circ C$)|\n| `date`| date of record|\n| `location`| location in London (`inner` or `outer`) |\n| `pm2_5`| concentration of PM2.5 ($\\mu g / m^3$)|\n| `rain_mm`| daily rainfall in mm (same across both locations)|\n| `wind_m_s`| wind speed in $m/s$|\n\n## Summarise and visualise\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nLet's first load the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npm2_5 <- read_csv(\"data/CS5-pm2_5.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 730 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): date, location\ndbl (4): avg_temp, pm2_5, rain_mm, wind_m_s\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(pm2_5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  avg_temp date       location pm2_5 rain_mm wind_m_s\n     <dbl> <chr>      <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>\n1      4.5 01/01/2019 inner     17.1     2.3     3.87\n2      4.9 01/01/2019 outer     10.8     2.3     5.84\n3      4.3 02/01/2019 inner     14.9     2.3     3.76\n4      4.8 02/01/2019 outer     11.4     2.3     6   \n5      4   03/01/2019 inner     18.5     1.4     2.13\n6      4.5 03/01/2019 outer     15.0     1.4     2.57\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's the `pm2_5` response variable we're interested in here.

I'm not surprised by this! So when we do our statistical testing, I would expect to find a clear difference between the locations.\n\nApart from the location, there are quite a few numerical descriptor variables. We could plot them one-by-one, but that's a bit tedious. So instead we use the `pairs()` function again. This only works on numerical data, so we select all the columns that are numeric with `select_if(is.numeric)`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npm2_5 %>% \n    select_if(is.numeric) %>% \n    pairs(lower.panel = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs5_practical_multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that there is not much of a correlation between `pm2_5` and `avg_temp` or `rain_mm`, whereas there might be something going on in relation to `wind_m_s`.\n\nOther notable things include that rainfall seems completely independent of wind speed (rain fall seems pretty constant). Nor does the average temperature seem in any way related to wind speed (it looks like a random collection of data points!).\n\nWe can visualise the relationship between `pm2_5` and `wind_m_s` in a bit more detail, by plotting the data against each other and colouring by `location`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pm2_5,\n       aes(x = wind_m_s, y = pm2_5,\n           colour = location)) +\n    geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs5_practical_multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems to show that there might be some linear relationship between PM2.5 levels and wind speed.\n\nAnother way of looking at this would be to create a correlation matrix, like we did before in the [correlations chapter](#correlation-coefficients):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npm2_5 %>% \n    select_if(is.numeric) %>% \n    cor()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            avg_temp       pm2_5     rain_mm    wind_m_s\navg_temp  1.00000000  0.03349457  0.03149221 -0.01107855\npm2_5     0.03349457  1.00000000 -0.02184951 -0.41733945\nrain_mm   0.03149221 -0.02184951  1.00000000  0.04882097\nwind_m_s -0.01107855 -0.41733945  0.04882097  1.00000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis confirms what we saw in the plots, there aren't any very strong correlations between the different (numerical) variables, apart from a negative correlation between `pm2_5` and `wind_m_s`, which has a Pearson's r of $r$ = -0.42.\n\n## Python\n\nLet's first load the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npm2_5_py = pd.read_csv(\"data/CS5-pm2_5.csv\")\n\npm2_5_py.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   avg_temp        date location   pm2_5  rain_mm  wind_m_s\n0       4.5  01/01/2019    inner  17.126      2.3      3.87\n1       4.9  01/01/2019    outer  10.821      2.3      5.84\n2       4.3  02/01/2019    inner  14.884      2.3      3.76\n3       4.8  02/01/2019    outer  11.416      2.3      6.00\n4       4.0  03/01/2019    inner  18.471      1.4      2.13\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's the `pm2_5` response variable we're interested in here.

At this point I should probably bite the bullet and install `seaborn`, so I can use the [pairplot()](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html) function.\n\nBut I'm not going to ;-)\n\nI'll just tell you that there is not much of a correlation between `pm2_5` and `avg_temp` or `rain_mm`, whereas there might be something going on in relation to `wind_m_s`. So I plot that instead and colour it by location:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(ggplot(pm2_5_py,\n        aes(x = \"wind_m_s\",\n            y = \"pm2_5\",\n            colour = \"location\")) +\n     geom_point())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs5_practical_multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-3.png){width=614}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems to show that there might be some linear relationship between PM2.5 levels and wind speed.\n\nIf I would plot all the other variables against each other, then I would spot that rainfall seems completely independent of wind speed (rain fall seems pretty constant). Nor does the average temperature seem in any way related to wind speed (it looks like a random collection of data points!). You can check this yourself!\n\nAnother way of looking at this would be to create a correlation matrix, like we did before in the [correlations chapter](#correlation-coefficients):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npm2_5_py.corr()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          avg_temp     pm2_5   rain_mm  wind_m_s\navg_temp  1.000000  0.033495  0.031492 -0.011079\npm2_5     0.033495  1.000000 -0.021850 -0.417339\nrain_mm   0.031492 -0.021850  1.000000  0.048821\nwind_m_s -0.011079 -0.417339  0.048821  1.000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis confirms what we saw in the plots, there aren't any very strong correlations between the different (numerical) variables, apart from a negative correlation between `pm2_5` and `wind_m_s`, which has a Pearson's r of $r$ = -0.42.\n:::\n\n## Implement and interpret the test\n\nFrom our initial observations we derived that there might be some relationship between PM2.5 levels and wind speed. We also noticed that this is likely to be different between inner and outer London.\n\nIf we would want to test for _every_ variable and interaction, then we would end up with a rather huge model, which would even include 3-way and a 4-way interaction! To illustrate the point that the process of model testing applies to as many variables as you like, we're adding the `avg_temp` and `rain_mm` variables to our model.\n\nSo in this case we create a model that takes into account all of the main effects (`avg_temp`, `location`, `rain_mm`, `wind_m_s`). We also include a potential two-way interaction (`location:wind_m_s`). The two-way interaction may be of interest since the PM2.5 levels in response to wind speed seem to differ between the two locations.\n\nOur model is then as follows:\n\n`pm2_5 ~ avg_temp + location + rain_mm + wind_m_s + wind_m_s:location`\n\nSo let's define and explore it!\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nWe write the model as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_pm2_5_full <- lm(pm2_5 ~ avg_temp + location +\n                            rain_mm + wind_m_s +\n                            wind_m_s:location,\n                    data = pm2_5)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's look at the coefficients:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_pm2_5_full\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pm2_5 ~ avg_temp + location + rain_mm + wind_m_s + \n    wind_m_s:location, data = pm2_5)\n\nCoefficients:\n           (Intercept)                avg_temp           locationouter  \n              18.18286                 0.01045                -2.07084  \n               rain_mm                wind_m_s  locationouter:wind_m_s  \n              -0.02788                -0.28545                -0.42945  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n## Extracting coefficients with `tidy()`\n\nThis will give us quite a few coefficients, so instead of just calling the `lm` object, I'm restructuring the output using the `tidy()` function from the `broom` package. It's installed with `tidyverse` but you have to load it separately using `library(broom)`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_pm2_5_full %>%\n    tidy() %>% \n    select(term, estimate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  term                   estimate\n  <chr>                     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)             18.2   \n2 avg_temp                 0.0105\n3 locationouter           -2.07  \n4 rain_mm                 -0.0279\n5 wind_m_s                -0.285 \n6 locationouter:wind_m_s  -0.429 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe question is, are all of these terms statistically significant?

Which means that we can't just talk about the effect of `location` or `wind_m_s` on PM2.5 levels, without taking the other variable into account!\n\nThe p-value for the `avg_temp` is significant, whereas the `rain_mm` main effect is not. This means that rain fall is not contributing much to model's ability to explain our data. This matches what we already saw when we visualised the data.\n\nWhat to do? We'll explore this in more detail in the chapter on model comparisons, but for now the most sensible option would be to redefine the model, but exclude the `rain_mm` variable. Here I have rewritten the model and named it `lm_pm2_5_red` to indicate it is a reduced model (with fewer variables than our original full model):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_pm2_5_red <- lm(pm2_5 ~ avg_temp + location + wind_m_s + location:wind_m_s, data = pm2_5)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's look at the new model coefficients:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_pm2_5_red\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pm2_5 ~ avg_temp + location + wind_m_s + location:wind_m_s, \n    data = pm2_5)\n\nCoefficients:\n           (Intercept)                avg_temp           locationouter  \n              18.13930                 0.01031                -2.07380  \n              wind_m_s  locationouter:wind_m_s  \n              -0.28631                -0.42880  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we did in the linear regression on grouped data, we end up with two linear equations, one for `inner` London and one for `outer` London.\n\nOur reference group is `inner` (remember, it takes a reference group in alphabetical order and we can see `outer` in the output).\n\nSo we end up with:\n\n$PM2.5_{inner} = 18.14 + 0.01 \\times avg\\_temp - 0.29 \\times wind\\_m\\_s$\n\n$PM2.5_{outer} = (18.14 - 2.07) + 0.01 \\times avg\\_temp + (-0.29 - 0.43) \\times wind\\_m\\_s$\n\nwhich gives\n\n$PM2.5_{outer} = 16.07 + 0.01 \\times avg\\_temp - 0.72 \\times wind\\_m\\_s$\n\n\nWe still need to check the assumptions of the model:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresid_panel(lm_pm2_5_red,\n            plots = c(\"resid\", \"qq\", \"ls\", \"cookd\"),\n            smoother = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs5_practical_multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey all look pretty good, with the only weird thing being a small empty zone of predicted values just under 16. Nothing that is getting me worried though.\n\nIt'd be useful to visualise the model. We can take the model and use the `augment()` function to extract the fitted values (`.fitted`).

This means that rain fall is not contributing much to model's ability to explain our data. This matches what we already saw when we visualised the data.\n\nWhat to do? We'll explore this in more detail in the chapter on model comparisons, but for now the most sensible option would be to redefine the model, but exclude the `rain_mm` variable.

These are the `pm2_5` that the model is predicting. We can then plot these against the `wind_m_s` measurements, colouring by `location`.

The variables are the height `height`, diameter `girth` and timber volume `volume` of 31 felled black cherry trees.\n\nInvestigate the relationship between `volume` (as a dependent variable) and `height` and `girth` (as predictor variables).\n\n* Here all variables are continuous and so there isn’t a way of producing a 2D plot of all three variables for visualisation purposes using R’s standard plotting functions.\n* construct four linear models\n    * Assume volume depends on `height`, `girth` and an interaction between `girth` and `height`\n    * Assume `volume` depends on `height` and `girth` but that there isn’t any interaction between them.\n    * Assume `volume` only depends on `girth` (plot the result, with the regression line).\n    * Assume `volume` only depends on `height` (plot the result, with the regression line).\n* For each linear model write down the algebraic equation that the linear model produces that relates volume to the two continuous predictor variables.\n* Check the assumptions of each model. Do you have any concerns?\n\nNB: For two continuous predictors, the interaction term is simply the two values multiplied together (so `girth:height` means `girth x height`)\n\n* Use the equations to calculate the predicted volume of a tree that has a diameter of 20 inches and a height of 67 feet in each case.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nLet's construct the four linear
