It is used to find out if the sample came from a parent distribution with a given mean (or median). This essentially boils down to finding out if the sample mean (or median) is \"close enough\" to our hypothesised parent population mean (or median).\nSo, in the figure below, we could use these tests to see what the probability is that the sample of ten points comes from the distribution plotted above it i.e. a population with a mean of 20 mm.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Choosing a test\nThere are two tests that we are going to look at in this situation; the one-sample t-test, and the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test. Both tests work on the sort of data that we’re considering here, but they both have different assumptions.\n\nIf your data is normally distributed, then a one-sample t-test is appropriate. If your data aren’t normally distributed, but their distribution is symmetric, and the sample size is small then a one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test is more appropriate.\n\nFor each statistical test we consider there will be five tasks. These will come back again and again, so pay extra close attention.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n1. Setting out of the hypothesis\n2. Summarise and visualisation of the data\n3. Assessment of assumptions\n4. Implementation of the statistical test\n5. Interpreting the output and presentation of results\n:::\n\nWe won’t always carry these out in exactly the same order, but we will always consider each of the five tasks for every test.\n\n## Data and hypotheses\n\nFor example, suppose we measure the body lengths of male guppies (in mm) collected from the Guanapo River in Trinidad. We want to test whether the data support the hypothesis that the mean body is actually 20 mm. We form the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\n-   $H_0$: The mean body length is equal to 20mm ($\\mu =$ 20).\n-   $H_1$: The mean body length is not equal to 20mm ($\\mu \\neq$ 20).\n\nWe will use a one-sample, two-tailed t-test to see if we should reject the null hypothesis or not.\n\n-   We use a **one-sample** test because we only have one sample.\n-   We use a **two-tailed** t-test because we want to know if our data suggest that the true (population) mean is different from 20 mm in either direction rather than just to see if it is greater than or less than 20 mm (in which case we would use a one-tailed test).\n-   We're using a **t-test** because we don't know any better yet and because I'm telling you to. We'll look at what the precise assumptions/requirements need to be in a moment.\n\nMake sure you have downloaded the data (see: [Data section](/materials#index-datasets)) and placed it within your working directory.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\n\nFirst we load the relevant libraries:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load rstatix, a tidyverse-friendly stats package\nlibrary(rstatix)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then read in the data and create a table containing the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# import the data\nfishlengthDF <- read_csv(\"data/CS1-onesample.csv\")\n\nfishlengthDF\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 29 × 3\n      id river   length\n   <dbl> <chr>    <dbl>\n 1     1 Guanapo   19.1\n 2     2 Guanapo   23.3\n 3     3 Guanapo   18.2\n 4     4 Guanapo   16.4\n 5     5 Guanapo   19.7\n 6     6 Guanapo   16.6\n 7     7 Guanapo   17.5\n 8     8 Guanapo   19.9\n 9     9 Guanapo   19.1\n10    10 Guanapo   18.8\n# … with 19 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first line reads the data into R and creates an object called a **tibble**, which is a type of **data frame**. This data frame contains 3 columns: a unique `id`, `river` encoding the river and `length` with the measured guppy length.\n\n## R\n\nWe then read in the data and create a vector containing the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# import the data\nfishlengthDF_r <- read.csv(\"data/CS1-onesample.csv\")\n\n# create a vector containing the data\nfishlength_r <- fishlengthDF_r$length\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe first line reads the data into R and creates an object called a data frame. This data frame only contains a single column of numbers called \"Guanapo\" (the name of the river). In most situations, and for most statistical analyses, having our data stored in a data frame is exactly what we'd want. However, for one sample tests we actually need our data to be stored as a vector. So, the second line extracts the values that are in the `Guanapo` column of our `fishlengthDF` data frame and creates a simple vector of numbers that we have called `fishlength_r` This step is only necessary for one-sample tests and when we look at more complex data sets, we won't need to do this second step at all.\n\n## Python\n\nWe then read the data in:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# load the data\nfishlength_py = pd.read_csv('data/CS1-onesample.csv')\n\n# inspect the data\nfishlength_py.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   id    river  length\n0   1  Guanapo    19.1\n1   2  Guanapo    23.3\n2   3  Guanapo    18.2\n3   4  Guanapo    16.4\n4   5  Guanapo    19.7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Summarise and visualise\n\nSummarise the data and visualise it:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(fishlengthDF)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       id        river               length    \n Min.   : 1   Length:29          Min.   :11.2  \n 1st Qu.: 8   Class :character   1st Qu.:17.5  \n Median :15   Mode  :character   Median :18.8  \n Mean   :15                      Mean   :18.3  \n 3rd Qu.:22                      3rd Qu.:19.7  \n Max.   :29                      Max.   :23.3  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the `summary()` output we can see that the mean and median of the `length` variable are quite close together.

Wilcoxon signed-rank test\n\nFor us to use a t-test for this analysis (and for the results to be valid) we have to make two assumptions:\n\n1.  The parent distribution from which the sample is taken is normally distributed (and as such the sample data are normally distributed themselves).\n\n::: callout-note\nIt is worth noting though that the t-test is actually pretty robust in situations where the sample data are not normal. For sufficiently large sample sizes (your guess is as good as mine, but conventionally this means about 30 data points), you can use a t-test without worrying about whether the underlying population is normally distributed or not.\n:::\n\n2.  Each data point in the sample is independent of the others. This is in general not something that can be tested for and instead has to be considered from the sampling procedure. For example, taking repeated measurements from the same individual would generate data that are not independent.\n\nThe second point we know nothing about and so we ignore it here (this is an issue that needs to be considered from the experimental design), whereas the first assumption can be checked. There are three ways of checking for normality:\n\nIn increasing order of rigour, we have\n\n1.  Histogram\n2.  Quantile-quantile plot\n3.  Shapiro-Wilk test\n\n### Histogram of the data\n\nPlot a histogram of the data, which gives:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfishlengthDF %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = length)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(fishlength_r, breaks = 15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(ggplot(fishlength_py,\n        aes(x = \"length\")) +\n     geom_histogram(bins = 15))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=614}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe distribution appears to be uni-modal and symmetric, and so it isn't obviously non-normal. However, there are a lot of distributions that have these simple properties but which aren't normal, so this isn't exactly rigorous. Thankfully there are other, more rigorous tests.\n\nNB. By even looking at this distribution to assess the assumption of normality we are already going far beyond what anyone else ever does. Nevertheless, we will continue.\n\n### Q-Q plot of the data\n\nQ-Q plot is the short for quantile-quantile plot. This **diagnostic** plot (as it is sometimes called) is a way of comparing two distributions. How Q-Q plots work won't be explained here but will be addressed in the next session.\n\nConstruct a Q-Q Plot of the quantiles of the data against the quantiles of a normal distribution:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfishlengthDF %>% \n  ggplot(aes(sample = length)) +\n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# plot the Q-Q plot\nqqnorm(fishlength_r)\n\n# and add a comparison line\nqqline(fishlength_r)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(ggplot(fishlength_py,\n        aes(sample = \"length\")) +\n     stat_qq() +\n     stat_qq_line())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=614}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWhat is important to know is that if the data were normally distributed then all of the points should lie on (or close to) the diagonal line in this graph.\n\nIn this case, the points lie quite close to the line for the most part but the sample quantiles (points) from either end of the sample distribution are either smaller (below the line on the left) or larger (above the line on the right) than expected if they were supposed to be normally distributed. This suggests that the sample distribution is a bit more spread out than would be expected if it came from a normal distribution.\n\nIt is important to recognise that there isn't a simple unambiguous answer when interpreting these types of graph, in terms of whether the assumption of normality has been well met or not and instead it often boils down to a matter of experience.\n\nIt is a very rare situation indeed where the assumptions necessary for a test will be met unequivocally and a certain degree of personal interpretation is always needed. Here you have to ask yourself whether the data are normal \"enough\" for you to be confident in the validity of the test.\n\nBelow are four examples of QQ plots for different types of distributions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese two graphs relate to 200 data points that have been drawn from a normal distribution. Even here you can see that the points do not all lie perfectly on the diagonal line in the QQ plot, and a certain amount of deviation at the top and bottom of the graph can happen just by chance (if I were to draw a different set of point then the graph would look slightly different).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese two graphs relate to 200 data points that have been drawn from a uniform distribution. Uniform distributions are more condensed than normal distributions, and this is reflected in the QQ plot having a very pronounced S-shaped pattern to it (this is colloquially known as **snaking**).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese two graphs relate to 200 data points that have been drawn from a t distribution. t distributions are more spread out than normal distributions, and this is reflected in the QQ plot again having a very pronounced S-shaped pattern to it, but this time the snaking is a reflection of that observed for the uniform distribution.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs1_practical_one-sample-t-test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese two graphs relate to 200 data points that have been drawn from an exponential distribution. Exponential distributions are not symmetric and are very skewed compared with normal distributions. The significant right-skew in this distribution is reflected in the QQ plot again having points that curve away above the diagonal line at both ends (a left-skew would have the points being below the line at both ends).\n\nIn all four cases it is worth noting that the deviations are only at the ends of the plot.\n\n### Shapiro-Wilk test\n\nThis is one of a number of formal statistical test that assess whether a given sample of numbers come from a normal distribution. It calculates the probability of getting the sample data if the underlying distribution is in fact normal. It is very easy to carry out in R.\n\nPerform a Shapiro-Wilk test on the data:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\nThe `shapiro.test()` function needs a numerical vector as input. We get this by extracting the `length` values with the `pull()` function. We then pipe this to the `shapiro.test()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfishlengthDF %>% \n    pull(length) %>% \n    shapiro.test()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.94938, p-value = 0.1764\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The 1st line gives the name of the test and the `data:` tells you which data are used. In our case this is coming from the pipe and is denoted as `.`\n-   The 3rd line contains the two key outputs from the test:\n-   The calculated W-statistic is 0.9494 (we don't need to know this)\n-   The p-value is 0.1764\n\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshapiro.test(fishlength_r)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  fishlength_r\nW = 0.94938, p-value = 0.1764\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The 1st line gives the name of the test and the 2nd line reminds you what the data set was called\n-   The 3rd line contains the two key outputs from the test:\n-   The calculated W-statistic is 0.9494 (we don't need to know this)\n-   The p-value is 0.1764\n\n## Python\n\nWe take the `length` values from the `fishlength_py` data frame and pass that to the `normality()` function in `pingouin`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npg.normality(fishlength_py.length)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n               W      pval  normal\nlength  0.949384  0.176418    True\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   the `W` column gives us the W-statistic\n-   the `pval` column gives us the p-value\n-   the `normal` column gives us the outcome of the test in `True/False`\n:::\n\nAs the p-value is bigger than 0.05 (say) then we can say that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the sample came from a normal distribution.\n\nIt is important to recognise that the Shapiro-Wilk test is not without limitations. It is rather sensitive to the sample size being considered. In general, for small sample sizes, the test is very relaxed about normality (and nearly all data sets are considered normal), whereas for large sample sizes the test can be overly strict, and it can fail to recognise data sets that are very nearly normal indeed.\n\n### Assumptions overview\n\n::: callout-important\nIn terms of assessing the assumptions of a test it is always worth considering several methods, both graphical and analytic, and not just relying on a single method.\n:::\n\nIn the `fishlength` example, the graphical Q-Q plot analysis was not especially conclusive as there was some suggestion of snaking in the plots, but the Shapiro-Wilk test gave a non-significant p-value (0.1764). Putting these two together, along with the original histogram and the recognition that there were only 30 data points in the data set I personally would be happy that the assumptions of the t-test were met well enough to trust the result of the t-test, but you may not be...\n\nIn which case we would consider an alternative test that has less stringent assumptions (but is less powerful): the [one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test](#cs1-onesample-wilcoxon-signed-rank).\n\n## Implement and interpret the test\n\nPerform a one-sample, two-tailed t-test:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfishlengthDF %>% \n    pull(length) %>% \n    t.test(mu = 20, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  .\nt = -3.5492, df = 28, p-value = 0.001387\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 20\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 17.31341 19.27969\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 18.29655 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The first argument must be a numerical vector of data values.

The standard significance level is 0.05 and since our p-value is smaller than this we choose to say that \"it is very unlikely that we would have this particular sample if the null hypothesis were true\".\n:::\n\nIn this case the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, so we reject our null hypothesis and state that:\n\n> A one-sample t-test indicated that the mean body length of male guppies ($\\bar{x}$ = 18.29mm) differs significantly from 20 mm (p = 0.0014).\n\nThe above sentence is an adequate concluding statement for this test and is what we would write in any paper or report. Note that we have included (in brackets) information on the actual mean value of our group($\\bar{x}$ = 18.29mm) and the p-value (p = 0.0014). In some journals you are only required to report whether the p-value is less than the critical value (e.g. p \\< 0.05) but I would always recommend reporting the actual p-value obtained.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nAdditional information, such as the test statistic and degrees of freedom, are sometimes also reported.

Note the ridiculous number of caveats here and the slightly political/slippery language I'm using. This is intentional and reflects the ambiguous nature of assumption checking. This is an important approach to doing statistics that you need to embrace.\n\nIn reality, if I found myself in this situation I would also try doing a non-parametric test on the data (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and see whether I get the same conclusion about whether the median dissolving time differs from 45s. Technically, you don't know about the Wilcoxon test yet as you haven't done that section of the materials. Anyway, if I get the same conclusion then my confidence in the result of the test goes up considerably; it doesn't matter how well an assumption has been met, I get the same result. If on the other hand I get a completely different conclusion from carrying out the non-parametric test then all bets are off; I now have very little confidence in my test result as I don't know which one to believe (in the case that the assumptions of the test are a bit unclear). In this example a Wilcoxon test also gives us a non-significant result and so all is good.\n\n### Implement test\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## tidyverse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# perform one-sample t-test\ndissolving %>% \n    pull(dissolving_time) %>% \n    t.test(mu = 45,\n           alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  .\nt = 0.36647, df = 7, p-value = 0.7248\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 45\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 43.84137 46.58363\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  45.2125 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(dissolving_r$dissolving_time,\n       mu = 45 ,\n       alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  dissolving_r$dissolving_time\nt = 0.36647, df = 7, p-value = 0.7248\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 45\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 43.84137 46.58363\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  45.2125 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npg.ttest(x = dissolving_py.dissolving_time,\n         y = 45,\n         alternative = \"two-sided\").round(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            T  dof alternative  p-val           CI95%  cohen-d   BF10  power\nT-test  0.366    7   two-sided  0.725  [43.84, 46.58]     0.13  0.356  0.062\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n> A one-sample t-test indicated that the mean dissolving time of the drug is not significantly different from 45s ($\\bar{x}$ = 45.2, p=0.725).\n\nAnd that, is that.\n:::\n\n## Key points\n\n::: callout-note\n-   One-sample tests are used when you have a single sample of continuous data\n-   The t-test assumes that the data are normally distributed and independent of each other\n-   A good way of assessing the assumption of normality is by checking the data against a Q-Q plot\n:::\n",
