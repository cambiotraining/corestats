Welcome to Core statistics!

These sessions are intended to enable you to perform core data analysis techniques appropriately and confidently using R or Python.

-   6 lecture-practicals
-   Ongoing formative assessment exercises
-   No formal assessment
-   No mathematical derivations
-   No pen and paper calculations

They are **not** a "how to mindlessly use a stats program" course!

## Core aims

There are several things that we try to achieve during this course.

## Course aims

To know what to do when presented with an arbitrary data set e.g.

1.  Know what data analysis techniques are available
2.  Know which ones are allowable
3.  Be able to carry these out and understand the results
:::

## Core topics

1.  Simple hypothesis testing
2.  Categorical predictors
3.  Continuous predictors
4.  Two predictors
5.  Multiple predictors
6.  Power analysis

## Practicals

Each practical document is divided up into various sections. In each section there will be some explanatory text which should help you to understand what is going on and what you're trying to achieve. There may be a list of commands relevant to that section which will be displayed in boxes like this:

## Conditional operators

To set filtering conditions, use the following *relational operators*:

-   `>` is greater than
-   `>=` is greater than or equal to
-   `<` is less than
-   `<=` is less than or equal to
-   `==` is equal to
-   `!=` is different from
-   `%in%` is contained in

To combine conditions, use the following *logical operators*:

-   `&` AND
-   `|` OR
