Welcome to Core statistics!

These sessions are intended to enable you to perform core data analysis techniques appropriately and confidently using R or Python.

-   6 lecture-practicals
-   Ongoing formative assessment exercises
-   No formal assessment
-   No mathematical derivations
-   No pen and paper calculations

They are **not** a "how to mindlessly use a stats program" course!
